        The VCOM voltages of every e-Paper panel are different and they are printed on FPC cable. Please make sure that
        you use the correct VCOM, otherwise, the display will become worse if the E-paper works under the wrong VCOM
        value for a long time.
        The default is -2.5V. For example, -1.53V should be set as 1530.
