# Power IC

A small IC for turning the main IC on and off periodically, ensuring that it doesn't consume too much power while idle.

## Flashing

Press the flash button on the board (it is mounted sideways) and use the nRF Programmer to flash the `zephyr.hex` file
(you can drag&drop it into the programmer).
